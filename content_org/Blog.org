:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: Using the 'register!
:END:

Usually when interacting with your computer, you are used to having one clipboard that gets overwritten if you copy something else, but in emacs we can have multiple 'clipboard' - meet the *register*

The register can store sevevral types of data, bee it a string, multiple lines of text or even the point in a buffer, but unlike the system clipboard, you can have several registers at the same time.

For instance, the command 'copy-to-register' will copy the current active region to a register. When you have selected the region and executed the command, you will then be prompted for which register to store the text - you must name the register, like the letter 'a' or the number '1', etc.

When you want to retrievev something from a register, you use the command 'insert-register'.

In the demo below, i copy two seperate regions of text into register 'a' and register 'b'. To specify the register, you just type the character when prompted.

If you use the command 'point-to-register', you can jump between different save-splot in the buffer, or across multiple buffers! Jump to those registers positions with 'jump-to-register'
